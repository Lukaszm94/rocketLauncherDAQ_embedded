# rocketLauncherDAQ_embedded
DAQ system
This system is created to be used by Rocketry Section members of Students' Astronautical Association at Warsaw University of Technology.
This repo contains software for two embedded systems: 'transmitterUnit', mounted on rocket launcher, and 'receiverUnit'.
A bit more information on that project can be found on my website: http://lukemeyer.me/rldas.php
